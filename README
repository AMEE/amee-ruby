Currently, you can read DataCategories, DataItems and DataItemValues. See 
examples/view_data_*.rb for simple usage examples. You can also get the list
of available Profiles. See examples/list_profiles.rb for details.

The gem will use the AMEE JSON API if the JSON gem is installed on the local
system. Otherwise the XML API will be used.

You can use the 'ameesh' app to interactively explore the AMEE data area. Run
'ameesh -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -s SERVER' to try it out. Source code for this 
tool is in bin/ameesh and lib/amee/shell.rb. Profiles are not accessible through
this interface yet.
